soil testing using various sensors and Arduino


The soil fertility is detected using NPK sensors. A major component of soil fertilizer is nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The knowledge of the soil nutrient concentration can help us to learn about nutritional deficiency or abundance in soils used to endorse plant production. Apart from measuring Soil NPK, you can also measure Soil Moisture Content using Soil Moisture Sensor, which is explained in my one previous video.

There are multiple methods of measuring the soil nutrient content like using some option sensors or using the spectrometer. But the spectral analysis method of determining the nutrient content is not convenient and the drawback is the data are only 60-70% correct. While comparing the spectral analysis method with traditional wet chemistry methods, the accuracy of the products is yet to be fully resolved, given the paucity of data in that regard.

So, here we will use a JXCT Soil NPK Sensor to detect the soil nitrogen, phosphorous & Potassium in the soil. The JXCT Soil NPK sensor is a low-cost, quick-responsive, high precision & portable Soil NPK Sensor that works with Modbus RS485. The advantage of this sensor over a traditional detection method is that it gives very fast measurement & data are highly accurate. All you need is to insert its probe in soil and get the reading using Arduino. So, letâ€™s learn in detail about the interfacing of Soil Nutrient Sensor or NPK Sensor with Arduino.
